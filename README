# Waveform Scripts - 

# In this repo, I have shared collection of my scripts for various waveform studies. 

* WaveformConstruction directory contains scripts used to construct GT waveform catalog from numerical simulations of binary black hole and black hole neutron stars. These scripts are ideally based for use only with Georgia Tech code MAYA. 


Note - While these can be adapted to similar codes, the scripts should be checked and tested before use. Note that these scripts are not maintained by the author anymore and for any studies, it is highly recommended using updated version of scripts which can be obtained from UT Austin NR group.
