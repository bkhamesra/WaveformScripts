# Waveform Scripts - 

In this repo, I have shared collection of my scripts for various waveform studies. 

## WaveformConstruction

This directory contains scripts developed by me to construct Georgia Tech waveform catalog from numerical simulations of binary black hole and 
black hole neutron stars. These scripts are ideally based for use only with Georgia Tech code MAYA. 

Numerical Relativity simulations allows one to model various types of gravitational wave sources like binary black hole, neutron star black hole and binary neutron 
stars. These simulations allow us to understand the system dynamics and their observational signatures. However, in their raw form, they are incompatible with other 
data analysis pipelines (like PyCBC, LalInference etc) and hence, cannot be directly used for gravitational wave searches of studies. These scripts are designed to 
process raw simulation data into cleaned H5 format to allow its use for data analysis and parameter estimation pipelines. To design these scripts, we follow reference https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01076. The scripts are split into the following two directories - 

1. **MatlabScripts** - This is first part of waveform generation. These scripts extracts the relevant files from numerical simulation data needed for generating the waveform, uses FFI method (based on FFT) described in https://arxiv.org/abs/1006.1632 to compute the strain from Psi4 data for each spherical harmonic mode, extrapolates waveform to infinity and cleans the waveform ends (optional). 
2. **PythonScripts** - These scripts further process the strain data generated by Matlab scrips. Functions include
 -> Mean centering,
 -> junk radiation removal,
 -> Metadata Generation 
 -> Initial configuration extraction from simulations datafiles (ShiftTracker*.asc, ihspin_mass_hn*.asc, BH_diagnostics_ah*.asc, pararameter file, stdout)
 -> Data compresssion to H5 using romspline package

The final h5 file ~25MB reduced from ~2GB of simulation data

**Note** - The author does not take any responsibility for the use of these scripts.  Note that these scripts are not maintained by the author anymore. For any studies, it is highly recommended using updated version of scripts which can be obtained from UT Austin NR group (please contact me or UT Austin NR Group). While these can be adapted for similar NR codes, the scripts should be checked and tested for compatibility before use.
