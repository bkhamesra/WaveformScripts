# Waveform Scripts - 

## In this repo, I have shared collection of my scripts for various waveform studies. 

1. **WaveformConstruction** directory contains scripts developed by me to construct Georgia Tech waveform catalog from numerical simulations of binary black hole and 
black hole neutron stars. These scripts are ideally based for use only with Georgia Tech code MAYA. 

Numerical Relativity simulations allows one to model various types of gravitational wave sources like binary black hole, neutron star black hole and binary neutron 
stars. These simulations allow us to understand the system dynamics and their observational signatures. However, in their raw form, they are incompatible with other 
data analysis pipelines (like PyCBC, LalInference etc) and hence, cannot be directly used for gravitational wave searches of studies. These scripts are designed to 
process raw simulation data to allow its use for data analysis and parameter estimation pipelines. To design these scripts, we follow reference https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01076




**Note** - The author does not take any responsibility for the use of these scripts. While these can be adapted for similar NR codes, the scripts should be checked 
and tested before use. Note that these scripts are not maintained by the author anymore. For any studies, it is highly recommended using updated version of scripts
which can be obtained from UT Austin NR group (please contact me or UT Austin NR Group).
